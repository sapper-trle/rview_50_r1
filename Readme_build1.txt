Rview 5.0 revision 1 build 1 readme
March 2020 - sapper

Fixed Import DXF so coordinates like 1024 not changed to 1023 due floating point issues.

Removed initialisation code in geometry unit since it uses 16 bit asm commands.

This version of Rview was built in Delphi 10.3 and this may have introduced unknown bugs due to upgrading code from Delphi 7.
Use with care, always have backups of your levels.
